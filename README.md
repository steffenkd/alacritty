alacritty configuration


This is my quite simple and spartanian alacritty configuration.  

If you want to edit anything, open the file ```alacritty.toml```, and search for different configuration options on the internet.  

Different themes can be added to ```alacritty-theme/themes```.  
Download them from [alacritty0-theme](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme) and change the path to the theme you want in the ```alacritty.toml``` file or create your own.     
I am using my own colorscheme, which is referred to as ```a_custom_pencil_dark.toml``` and is an adapation of ```pencil_dark.toml```.  

Inside the file ```custom_color``` are several other adapted color themes.
