alacritty configuration


This is my quite simple and spartanian alacritty configuration.  

If you want to edit anything, open the file ```alacritty.toml```, and search for different configuration options on the internet.  

Different themes can be found under ```alacritty-theme/themes```.  
I am using my own colorscheme, which is reffered to as ```a_custom_pencil_dark.toml``` and is an adapation of ```pencil_dark.toml```.
